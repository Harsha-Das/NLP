Both BOW and TF-IDF approach do not store the semantic information. TF-IDF gives importance to uncommon words.

There is a definite chance of overfitting.

In Word2Vec, each word is basically represented as a vector of 32 or more dimension instead of a single number.

Here, the Semantic information and relation between different words is also preserved.
