# NLP
Different Process of the Text Analytics:-

1. TOKENIZATION 

Tokenization is a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It’s a fundamental step in both traditional NLP methods like Count Vectorizer and Advanced Deep Learning-based architectures like Transformers.

    Tokens are the building blocks of Natural Language.

Tokenization is a way of separating a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. Here, tokens can be either words, characters, or subwords. Hence, tokenization can be broadly classified into 3 types – word, character, and subword (n-gram characters) tokenization.

2. STEMMING

Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as a lemma. Stemming is important in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP). Stemming is also a part of queries and Internet search engines.

3. LEMMATIZATION

Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.

4. BAG OF WORDS

A bag-of-words model, or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling, such as with machine learning algorithms.

The approach is very simple and flexible, and can be used in a myriad of ways for extracting features from documents.

A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:

    A vocabulary of known words.
    A measure of the presence of known words.

5. TF-IDF

TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency 

TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents. This is done by multiplying two metrics: how many times a word appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents. It has many uses, most importantly in automated text analysis, and is very useful for scoring words in machine learning algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP). TF-IDF was invented for document search and information retrieval.
